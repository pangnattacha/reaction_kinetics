# Project: Kinetic modeling of simple reaction network

## Introduction
This project is to create **MATLAB** code comparing to **Python** code for fitting data with a chemical reaction model as shown below:

## Objective
To optimize kinetic rate constants (k) that give the best fitting with the chemcial reactions.

## Methodology
### Techonologies used
- MATLAB
- Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy

## Key finding
The k values were optimized using two different programming languages and approaches. One can work with MATLAB by looking at data table as a matrix.
Whereas, data is stored in array in case of Python, which make it a little more inconvenient in this case.
