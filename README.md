# Reaction kinetics

## Introduction
This project is to create **MATLAB** code for fitting data with a chemical reaction model as shown below:

## Problem setup
Optimizing kinetic rate constant (k) of each reaction that fit the experimental data [here](https://github.com/pangnattacha/reaction_kinetics/blob/master/data_dummy.xlsx) with the prediction from this model.

## Create kinetic rate equations from the model
Assuming the first order reactions, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are expressed as

The ODEs are stored as a function called [`ode`](https://github.com/pangnattacha/reaction_kinetics/blob/master/ode.m)

## Find optimum k
To integrate ODEs, a local function called `pred` using MATLAB function called [`ode45`](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ode45.html?requestedDomain=) was created. Then k values were optimized using MATLAB function called [`lsqnonlin`](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/lsqnonlin.html). These codes are stored inside the function [`fun1`](https://github.com/pangnattacha/reaction_kinetics/blob/master/fun1.m)

## Report the result
A script `result` for loading the datafile, calling the functions to optimize k values to fit the reaction model can be found [here](https://github.com/pangnattacha/reaction_kinetics/blob/master/result.m)
